                  Hi there! My name is Nicolette, and I'm a recent graduate from
                  University of Denver with a certificate in coding. As a
                  Frontend Web Developer, I'm passionate about creating
                  beautiful, responsive, and user-friendly websites that provide
                  a great user experience. While I don't have any professional
                  work experience yet, I've spent the past few years honing my
                  skills and building my portfolio. I have experience with a
                  variety of frontend technologies, including HTML, CSS,
                  JavaScript, and popular frameworks like React. I'm also
                  proficient in design tools such as Figma and Sketch.
                  Throughout my academic career, I've had the opportunity to
                  work on several projects that have challenged me and helped me
                  grow as a developer. One of my favorite projects was a mock-up
                  of a hotel called the Mallie, where I worked very in depth on
                  the spa page- making it aesthetically pleasing as well as
                  functional, with added pricing and booking features. I'm
                  excited to begin my career as a Frontend Web Developer and am
                  eager to contribute my skills and knowledge to a dynamic and
                  innovative team. Please feel free to connect with me on
                  LinkedIn or email me at nicoletteboggs@gmail.com to learn more
                  about my experience and skills. You can check out my Github
